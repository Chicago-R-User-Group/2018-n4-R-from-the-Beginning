## Chicago R User Group {.smaller .columns-2}

We have a new header graphic for our [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG) page. It clearly indicates the more R meetups one attends, the more proficient one becomes with `R`!

```{r, out.width = "450px", fig.align='left'}
path1 <- paste0(getwd(), "/images/CRUG_Header.png")
knitr::include_graphics(path1)
```



**CRUGtools:** An R package containing data and functions to help run the Chicago R User Group.

knitr::include_graphics(path)
```

From the inaugural conference in 2009, the annual R/Finance conference in Chicago has become the primary meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in Finance. Participants from academia and industry mingle for two days to exchange ideas about current research, best practices and applications.

The best part is, it takes place right in our backyard!
